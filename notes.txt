NETWORKED TECHNOLOGY
TCP - Transmission Control Protocol. it is responsible for establishing and maintaining a reliable communication channel between two devices over a network.
It is built on top of IP.
It assumes IP might lose some data- stores and retransmits data if it seems to be lost.
It handles "flow control" using a transmit window.
It provides a nice reliable pipe.

TCP Connections are called Sockets. Socket is an endpoint of a bidirectional inter-process communication flow across an Internet Protocol-based computer network, such as the Internet.

TCP Port Numbers
A port is an aplication-specific or process-specific software communications endpoint.
It allows multiple networked applications to coexist on the same server.
There is a list of well-known TCP port numbers.
Port 80 connects to the web servers
Port 443 is the secure HTTPS.

COMMON TCP PORTS
Telnet(23) - Login
SSH(22) - Secure Login
HTTP(80)
HTTPS(443) - Secure
SMTP(25) - Mail
IMAP(143/220/993) - Mail Retrieval
POP (109/110) - Mail Retrieval
DNS (53) - Domain Name
FTP(21) - File Transfer

HTTP - HyperText Transfer Protocol
It is the dominant application layer protocol on the internet.
It was invented for the web.
It is a set of rules that allow browsers to retrieve documents from servers over the internet
